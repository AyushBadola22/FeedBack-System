Thank you for providing that overview. Your teacher feedback system sounds like an interesting and complex project. Let's break it down and start planning the structure of your MERN application.

1. Database Schema (MongoDB):
   Let's start by defining the main collections we'll need:

   a) Users:
   ```
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     uid: String,
     name: String,
     email: String,
     password: String (hashed),
     role: String (enum: ['admin', 'teacher', 'student']),
     department: String (for teachers),
     section: String (for students)
   }
   ```

   b) Feedback:
   ```
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     studentId: ObjectId (ref: Users),
     teacherId: ObjectId (ref: Users),
     rating: Number,
     comment: String,
     isReported: Boolean,
     createdAt: Date
   }
   ```

   c) Attendance:
   ```
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     studentId: ObjectId (ref: Users),
     teacherId: ObjectId (ref: Users),
     subjectId: ObjectId (ref: Subjects),
     attendancePercentage: Number
   }
   ```

   d) Subjects:
   ```
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     name: String,
     department: String,
     teacherId: ObjectId (ref: Users)
   }
   ```

2. Backend (Node.js & Express.js):
   Set up routes for:
   - User authentication (login, logout)
   - CRUD operations for users (admin only)
   - CRUD operations for feedback
   - CRUD operations for attendance
   - CRUD operations for subjects
   - Reporting feedback
   - Getting average ratings for teachers

3. Frontend (React):
   Create components for:
   - Login page
   - Dashboard (different views for admin, teacher, and student)
   - Feedback form (for students)
   - Feedback display (for teachers)
   - User management (for admin)
   - Subject management (for admin)
   - Attendance record display

4. Key Features to Implement:
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Role-based access control
   - Feedback submission with attendance check
   - Average rating calculation for teachers
   - Reporting system for offensive feedback
   - Admin panel for user and subject management

5. Next Steps:
   1. Set up your development environment (Node.js, MongoDB, etc.)
   2. Initialize your project (create-react-app for frontend, express generator for backend)
   3. Set up your MongoDB database
   4. Start building your backend API
   5. Create your React components and implement the frontend logic
   6. Integrate frontend with backend
   7. Test thoroughly
   8. Deploy your application

Would you like me to guide you through setting up the initial project structure? Or do you have any questions about this plan?
